# ML-Library-2
Phase 1 : Implementation of a light CNN architecture and tabulating its performance on a range of self-implemented activation functions and optimizers. Phase 2: Implementation of a 'grid-search' feature for selecting the implemented optimizer and activation functions which work best for a given dataset for a simple neural network.
